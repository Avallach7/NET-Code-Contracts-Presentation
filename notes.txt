# What is contract programming?
# How .NET contract are implemented?
Contract methods are declared in .NET Base Class Library in static class System.Diagnostics.Contracts.Contract. All of them are just stubs, and nearly all of them are compiled conditionally only if “CONTRACTS_FULL” is defined. If compiled “normally”, they do nothing and does not affect performance nor assembly size. 
Instead, code containing contracts can be processed with two kinds of tools:
 - Binary rewriter (CCRewrite) - takes compiled assembly and inserts into it bytecode actually validating the contract in runtime, which often could be quite long if implemented by hand
 - Static checker - analyses the code flow and reports violations that can be spotted without running the application
Open source implementations of both are available at https://github.com/Microsoft/CodeContracts.

# Current and future support in .NET Framework
Code Contracts were developed as research project at Microsoft. They were used by many internal and external projects, such as Entity Framework, and their interface is part of .NET Core.  
Unfortunately there are currently no plans to provide rewriter and static checker for .NET Core.
